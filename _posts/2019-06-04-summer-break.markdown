School is almost over! It will be over in 16 days. When school is over I will go to Great Wolf Lodge! I cant wait for school to end!

Another thing I am exited about is the next prereleas for magic the gathering (my favorite card game)! The next set is core set 2020. Also I get to play with a friend! The friend I will play with is kiran. I am very exited to play with my friend!

I also am exited about the new electric guitar that my dad got! My favorite song to play on the guitar smoke on the water by Deep Purpple. I also like to play come as you are by Nirvana! I am really looking forward to summer break it will be the best!
