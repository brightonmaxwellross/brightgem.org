My first ruby meet up went well i got to share about [my d&d related game](https://github.com/brightonmaxwellross/dice.rb/blob/master/dice.rb) this is what I shared...

----

I am Brighton, and I would like to show you a Ruby game that I have made.

The game I have made is similar to Dungeons & Dragons, and involves dice rolling.

There are classes that I made for the Player, for the dice you roll, and the monsters.

When you start playing, the computer will automatically roll dice that are twenty-sided, to determine your life.

Then it will ask you if you are ready to play, and if your answer starts with a "y", it will start a battle.

When a battle is started, it rolls a twenty-sided dice. If the roll is less than or equal to 4, the monster you fight will be a boss, but if it's not less than or equal to 4, you will fight a normal monster.

A battle has turns: one for the player, and one for the monster. Until you or the monster reaches zero life, the battle will continue. The player or the monster will take damage equal to a roll of a twelve-sided dice.

After you finish the first battle, there will be another battle. When you finish your second battle, you will see a shop, and you get to decide if you want to go into the shop. If your answer starts with "y", you do go into the shop, and when you go into the shop, you will sleep at the inn and you'll go to full health.

And then you do battles until you see another shop, and you continue that same way until your health reaches zero.

This Ruby program is not finished yet, and I will keep working on it to make it better. One of the things I want to do to make this program better is make weapons that deal more damage, and potions to heal.

Thank you for listening.
